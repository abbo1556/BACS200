            Children look at the world without boundaries. Anything seems possible. Children have not yet allowed the chaos in our world to limit their dreams. Walt Disney recognized that we all deserve to view the world the way a child does, with wonder, curiosity, and joy.

           Walt was full of creativity, and he wanted to share that with the world. Disney wanted to create a place where children and adults could come together, and where adults could go to rediscover what it feels like to be a child. He felt we should have the opportunity to feel that wonder and ability to dream again.

            Disney gave us an escape from the real world where all your worries could be left behind, and you are invited to step into a place of magic. I am not only talking about Disney Land or even Disney World. These ideas are present in his movies and all entertainment he created. Throughout Walt Disneyâ€™s life, he faced many challenges and many failures. He never gave up. He would get right back up every time the world pushed him down. He knew how important it was to continue down the path he was creating.  He showed me that even in our darkest moments, when we feel like we are at our absolute lowest, great things can happen.

          When I had the opportunity to work at Disney, I had the privilege to carry on that important task of creating magic for others, children and adults alike. It made me see how important it is that we allow ourselves to dream and allow ourselves to believe that anything is possible.
