            <h2>1. Pitch Meetings</h2>
            <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1046062674365362176/pu/img/QS-BNhdV-_qqGw0f.jpg" alt="Ryan George" width="400"> <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PQdudhxl8Ro/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Ryan George" width="400">

            <p>Ryan George does videos through Screen Rant on Youtube where he acts as the person pitching movies to a producer. He plays both parts, and makes fun of different movies and how the plots work through his "pitch". </p>
            <p>He has various catchphrases that are a part of each video such as: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Super easy, barely an inconvenience</li>
                <li>Describing anything as "tight" </li>
                <li>Whoops, Whoopsie</li>
                <li>Yeah, yeah,yeah!</li>
            </ul>
            <p> These will make more sense, of course, if you watch some of the videos! I have provided a link to a more recent one: the pitch meeting for Twilight, as well as link to more pitch meetings if you want to see more! </p>

                <h2>2. Dog Videos and Jokes</h2>
                <p>I am definitely a complete dog person. I love seeing videos about dogs doing silly or cute things or fun relatable jokes about dogs.</p>

                <h2>3. Faceswap Videos</h2>
                <p>Faceswap videos are so strange. I love them because they always leave me wondering "What did I just watch?" However, even with how weird they are, I cannot stop laughing and I always want to watch them again. I have two favorites. </p>
                <p>The first one is a dad who puts his face on his daughters. It is so unsettling and hilarious at the same time. It is also a video that is now frequently quoted in my house. The video I have posted a link to is actually one of several that this dad has created. The Channel on Youtube is called Woodsie TV. </p>

                    </a></p>
                <p>My other favorite faceswap video is for those who know Nick Offerman (Ron Swanson) from Parks and Recreation, and Full House. A video was made of the opening title sequence of full house, where all the characters have Ron Swanson's face. </p>
