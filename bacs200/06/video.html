    <h3>Loss of Privacy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Information easier to steal</li>
        <li>GPS tracking and facial recognition</li>
        <li>Collection of our information by companies (data mining) </li>
        <li>Legislation is having a hard time keeping up enough to protect from dangers</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Social Media</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>False information is being spread/false accounts</li>
        <li>People spending too much time on social media so it takes away from work/school, which can lead to loss of productivity</li>
        <li>Spending too much time on technology affects ability to effectively communicate in person</li>
        <li>Security Risks</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Accountability: who is responsible when something goes wrong?</li>

        <li>AI can only make decisions based on what it is given it cannot factor in other variables that it wasn’t prepared for. This also means they can make biased decisions based on how they are programmed as well.</li>
        <li>Self-driving cars safety</li>
        <li>Weaponizing of technology/drones</li>
    </ul>
    <p>---Both for self-driving car safety and weaponizing of AI there is this danger in giving machines the power over people’s lives.</p>
    <h3>Dependency</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Addiction, anxiety, depression- mental health</li>
        <li>People do not have to possess as much knowledge because we rely so heavily on technology to do tasks for us</li>
        <li>Need for instant gratification. We are so used to the speed of technology that there is an expectation that everything should be done immediately.</li>
        <li>Lack of work-life balance because of the ability to take it home because of constant connection</li>

    </ul>
