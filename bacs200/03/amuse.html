        <h2>1. Pitch Meetings</h2>

        <p>Ryan George does videos through Screen Rant on Youtube where he acts as the person pitching movies to a producer. He plays both parts, and makes fun of different movies and how the plots work through his "pitch". </p>
        <p>He has various catchphrases that a part of every video such as: </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Super easy, barely an inconvenience</li>
            <li>Describing anything as "tight" </li>
            <li>Whoops, Whoopsie</li>
            <li>Yeah, yeah,yeah!</li>
        </ul>
        <p> These will make more sense, of course, if you watch some of the videos! I have provided a link to a more recent one: the pitch meeting for Twilight, as well as link to more pitch meetings if you want to see more! </p>

          <h3>2. Dogs Being Funny</h3>   
        <p>I am definitely a complete dog person. I love seeing videos about dogs doing silly or cute things or even fun relatable jokes about dogs.</p>
