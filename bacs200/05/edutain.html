                    <li>Simon Sinek talks about "the golden circle", involving our "what", our "how", and our "why"</li>
                    <li>Everyone knows their what, some people know how, and not very many know why. However he argues that the "why" is the most important. It is what makes people more inspiring, and therefore more successful.</li>
                    <li>My favorite quote in this video is when he states :"People dont buy what you do, they buy why you do it"</li>
                    <li>It is even more powerful as he gives examples of statements that show what versus why and how different they sound.</li>

                    <li>Sir Ken Robinson talks about how important creativity is in order to move forward into the future, and how education is what can lead us to where we need to go in the future.
                    <li>He then addresses how children are not afraid to make mistakes. Even if they do not know, they will try.</li>
                    <li>My favorite quote is "If you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original".</li>
                    <li>Education and the workplace tell us, though, that mistakes are the worst things you can do. He argues that this means, as we are educated, we tend to lose our abilities to be creative.</li>

                    <li>This entire video is in sign language.Christine Sun Kim addresses how sound is a sort of "social currency" and that those who cannot hear should not be cut off from possessing "social currency".
                    <li>People tend to assume sound cannot be a part of her world. She makes the point that she may have to be more aware of sound than we do.</li>
                    <li>She also talks about how being a part of the deaf community does not mean music cannot be part of life. She compares sign language to music and addresses the beauty of visuals related to music and sign language alike.

                    <li>Dan Pink talks about numerous studies that have been done that show that incentives do not motivate the way we would think they would.</li>
                    <li>People assume that the higher the reward offered, the better the performance of that task. However, it only works this way if the task does not involve cognitive skills.</li>
                    <li> He talks about how the opposite is actually true: The higher the reward for a cognitive task, the worse the perforamce is.</li>
                    <li> Pink then explains this is because of the importance of 3 main factors: Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose.</li>

                    <li>Dave Coplin talks about how with technology, we can choose specifically what is private and what we choose to show those around us. However traditional communication in the workplace has been more open and collaborative.</li>
                    <li> He claims that productivity has been a problem. Work is viewed differently than it has been in the past.</li>
                    <li>People are experiencing more stress and anxiety from feeling more exposed and monitored constantly.</li>
                    <li>Fleixble working is leading to people to have a harder time separating work and personal life. It does not have to be that way. People feel that way but it should not need to be that way.</li>
                    <li>Employees do not trust each other to work if they are outside the office. Also, people feel guilty themselves if they are not working, so they end up working more than they should and it hurts creativity and the benefits that are supposed to come from a flexible schedule.</li>
