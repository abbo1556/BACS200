            <li>This entire video is in sign language.Christine Sun Kim addresses how sound is a sort of "social currency" but that those who cannot hear should not be cut off from possessing "social currency". 
            <li>People tend to assume sound cannot be a part of her world. She makes the point that she may have to be more aware of sound than we do.</li>
            <li>She also talks about how beaing a part of the deaf community does not mean music cannot be part of life. She compares sign language to music and addresses the beauty of visuals related to music and sign language alike.
