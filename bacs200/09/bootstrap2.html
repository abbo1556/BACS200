                                    <li>Simon Sinek talks about "the golden circle", involving our "what", our "how", and our "why"</li>
                                    <li>Everyone knows their what, some people know how, and not very many know why. However he argues that the "why" is the most important. It is what makes people more inspiring, and therefore more successful.</li>
                                    <li>My favorite quote in this video is when he states :"People dont buy what you do, they buy why you do it"</li>
                                    <li>It is even more powerful as he gives examples of statements that show what versus why and how different they sound.</li>

                                    <li>He then addresses how children are not afraid to make mistakes. Even if they do not know, they will try.</li>
                                    <li>My favorite quote is "If you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original".</li>
                                    <li>Education and the workplace tell us, though, that mistakes are the worst things you can do. He argues that this means, as we are educated, we tend to lose our abilities to be creative.</li>

                                    <li>People tend to assume sound cannot be a part of her world. She makes the point that she may have to be more aware of sound than we do.</li>
                                    <li>She also talks about how being a part of the deaf community does not mean music cannot be part of life. She compares sign language to music and addresses the beauty of visuals related to music and sign language alike.

                                    <li>People assume that the higher the reward offered, the better the performance of that task. However, it only works this way if the task does not involve cognitive skills.</li>
                                    <li> He talks about how the opposite is actually true: The higher the reward for a cognitive task, the worse the perforamce is.</li>
                                    <li> Pink then explains this is because of the importance of 3 main factors: Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose.</li>
