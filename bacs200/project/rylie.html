                            I was not even serious about looking for a dog. I just like looking at puppies on Petfinder.com when I need some cuteness in my life. As I was scrolling, one dog made me stop in my tracks. She was at a foster home about 2 hours from me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I reached out to the foster mom, just curious what this dog’s story was. She told me the dog was hit by a car and the shelter was going to put her down because they didn’t have the money for a vet to look at her.

                            <p> She was put on one of those “urgent” lists and this foster mom managed to rescue her only 2 hours before she was put down. Her back was a little sensitive but otherwise there was nothing wrong, she must’ve just been lucky. </p>

                            <p> I had been injured recently too so this dog’s story really got to me. Luckily I was driving down for a vacation and happened to be going through the city where she was being fostered. I arranged to meet her and instantly fell in love.</p>

                            <p> I had to wait to actually take her home since we were just starting our vacation. A couple weeks later the foster mom drove all the way to me to drop her off. I named her Rylie.
                            </p>
                            <p>She used to eat her food faster than you could put it down. However, once she learned that she actually would get food every day now she likes to just sit and watch it.She likes the idea of having food more than the food itself.</p>
                            <p>She loves to be outside and she has a mind all her own. She knows what you want her to do and she will do it all on her own time. I love her personality and she is the best and most loving dog that I have ever had. I think back on how lucky I am she was rescued in time and that she rescued me too. </p>
