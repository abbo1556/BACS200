                            Before I moved to Colorado I made pillow cases for kids at the Dell Children Hospital.
                        </p>
                        <p> I liked to sew and there was a group of women at my church who would make these pillow cases .</p>
                        <p>The fabric was donated and then they would send me home with the materials for 5 pillow cases.</p>
                        <p>I would bring them back finished, and would receive the material for more.</p>

                        <p>It got to the point they would send 10 home with me at a time because I would spend so much of my time making them.</p>
                        <p>I ended up making over a hundred pillow cases! They would turn out so cute and it was extremely rewarding to know they were going to a good cause.</p>
