                        <p>My favorite time of year at Disney World is Halloween! The Halloween season at Disney begins the second week of August and goes to October 31st. </p>
                        <p>During this time, the parks are decorated for Halloween and the Magic Kingdom hosts Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween parties! Not only are these parties incredibly fun to attend, they were actually the most fun to work as well. </p>
                        <p>They have the headless horseman start off the Boo to You parade, which is the coolest parade.The characters who come out in this parade look incredible and it truly is mesmerizing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They also run the Hocus Pocus Villain Spelltacular on the stage of Cinderella’s castle. All the villains are a part of it, and it is hosted by the Sanderson Sisters from the Hocus Pocus movie.</p>
                        <p>The whole show is amazing but I especially love it because the Shadow man from Princess and the Frog plays a significant part in it. </p>
                        <p>Guests get to go trick-or-treating at locations all over the park and meet special characters that only meet around Halloween. They also had Hallowishes when I worked there, which is one of my favorite fireworks shows. Sadly, it was replaced by a new fireworks show now. </p>
                        <p> The best part is that everyone gets to dress up! Since this is Disney, a lot of guests go all out and have super fun costumes! When we attended as guests we dressed up as Rapunzel and Flynn and took some fun pictures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Working the Halloween parties, we put our mickey ghost temporary tattoos on our faces, our glow in the dark name tag frame, and got bingo cards. </p>
                        <p>
                            The bingo cards had different characters and we got to see if we could find guests dressed as each of the characters. It allowed us to have more of a chance to interact with our guests in a fun way! </p>
                        <p> Actually, my favorite costume I saw a guest wear to one of the parties was not even Disney. He had dressed up as the haunted shopping list/ghost from Spongebob, it was perfect. </p>
                        <p>Another aspect of the Halloween parties is that all the music would change from the nice main street music to fun Halloween music! Surprisingly I never got tired of the parties and I would love to do it a hundred times more!
