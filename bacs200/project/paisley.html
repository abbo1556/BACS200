                            I used to volunteer at an animal shelter in Texas. When we decided to adopt another dog, this is the first shelter I would check. </p>
                        <p> When we went to visit , they had just brought in a massive litter of Belgian Malinois mix puppies. </p>
                        <p>As cute as they were, my family was not sure if they wanted a plain black dog. I googled adult black belgian malinois and it sold my whole family because the pictures were stunning.</p>
                        <p>She was going to be a very beautiful dog. </p>
                        <p>When we came back to pick her up once she was old enough, we found out a lot of her litter had died of Parvo. </p>
                        <p>The shelter was not sure if our puppy had it or not so they quarantined her in a room with only cat kennels.</p>
                        <p>We would come to visit her every day and had to wear protective gear so that we didnâ€™t spread any germs to her. </p>
                        <p>Much to the dismay of the staff my brother and I also taught her how to howl.</p>
                        <p>After a few weeks they concluded she did not have parvo like her siblings and that we were free to take her home.</p>
                        <p>We named her Paisley after the country singer Brad Paisley.</p>
                        <p>She is very protective of our family and extremely selective in who she chooses to accept.</p>
                        <p>The people she loves , she loves very deeply. She is the most cuddly dog we have ever had and she is spoiled beyond belief.</p>
