I want my page to demonstrate who I am outside of just being a business student. People who visit my page can see the things that have brought me joy and/ or shaped me into the person I am now. I hope the experiences I share can make someone else smile. I want to demonstrate these experiences through pictures, video content,and miniature articles that tell my stories. My 5 categories of content include the home page, sewing/quilting, animals/pets, Disney, and photoscavenger hunts. I also plan to link to related content as well. For example when I post about making pillow cases Iâ€™d like to link to a how-to video so that others can make them too. In order to accomplish this project, I will need to obtain a better understanding of bootstrap and its capabilities, as well as, CSS in general. I hope this page tells the story of who I am. 

For Milestone 3, I am going to add a Hoverable Dropdown in photo.html, A Scroll to Top Button in photo.html, a Slideshow Gallery in highlights.html, Custom Check Boxes in challenge.html, and Modal Images in montana.html. These will be my 5 "tricks" from W3schools.

For milestone 4 I have started google analytics to track my website. I have uploaded a snippet of my use of the analytics. It is named analytics.png. I have also added facebook like/share/sign up buttons to the main pages including photo.html,disney.html,sewing.html and animals.html.
